## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache. Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}

##these functions are the examples provided. They are here for reference.
makeVector <- function(x = numeric()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y #superassignment operator <<-
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean
        getmean <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setmean = setmean,
             getmean = getmean)
}
cachemean <- function(x, ...) {
        m <- x$getmean()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
